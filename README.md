## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Bootstrap v5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)



### What I learned

This is the first time that I try to build a website with mobile-first workflow, I have to say it way easier to work with. Esspecially, we can utilize Bootstrap better with this workflow.
Thanks to this project I have had a better understanding of Bootstrap grid properties.
Also, I learned some new code in JavaScript:

- JavaScript Number `toFixed( )` Method: use this to work with floating point.
- A way to reload a webpage:

```js
location.reload();
```
